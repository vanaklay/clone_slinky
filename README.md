# Clone of Slinky by Vanak LAY
Try to clone demo functionality from Slinky by [Alizahid](https://github.com/alizahid/slinky)

## Setup 
This app works with : 
- Last React 
- Node version > v14.17.0
### Clone this project on your computer
```
git clone https://github.com/vanaklay/clone_slinky.git
```
### Install dependencies 
```
npm i 
```

I use CSSTransition to handle the css because i don't understand why the state doesn't updated.

### Points to improve
- The transition must be improve 
- Try recursive render component because if there's more depth, it can't work
